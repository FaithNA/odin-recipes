In this mini project, I made use of the following concepts which I learned

# Creating and cloning the GitHub repo
A github repo was created for this project which was then cloned onto my local machine using git clone + the ssh link

# Creating the directories and files
The commmand line was used to create the directories and files use the command mkdir and touch

# Web page content
The web pages were made with the html boilerplate, h1 and h3 headings, the anchor tag for links with href attribute, the image tag with alt, width and height attribute, the ordered and unordered list tags, and the paragraph tag for normal text.
